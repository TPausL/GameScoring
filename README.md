# GameScoring

## Description
This app provides a scoring card for multiple board and card games. It is written in [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com), so it theoretically works in a browser but i thought to be mobile only and won't be hosted.
The following games are implemented/planned. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/TPausL/GameScoring/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new+feature&template=new-game.md&title=) if you have ideas.

 ## Technical Setup
 ### Prerequisites
 As it is an Ionic App all [prerequisites](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/environment) from the framework are needed (node with packagemanager (preferably pnpm) is mandatory, build tools are optional if you want to build for your device but development works fine with just the browser)
 
 ### Scripts
 (they can be used with the package manager of your choice)
 First install npm packages with `pnpm install`
 
 `pnpm start` starts the development server and watches the files for hot reload in the browser.
 
 `pnpm build` builds the static website from the react code.
